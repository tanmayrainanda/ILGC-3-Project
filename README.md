# ILGC-3-Project
Info will be added here as we progress

Test-Env is a virtual environment that has been created to experiment before deployment.
Added tags for raising different types of issues. 
Added security clearance for collaborators. In case an external user wishes to edit or fork this repo, approval will be required
NEVER, and I mean NEVER approve an external user. No code stealing, hehe

Do not edit codeql.yaml (it's our security config to protect our code and data)
