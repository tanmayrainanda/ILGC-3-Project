# Chips Thermal Face Dataset
## Thermal images; 8 participants; over 1,200 images total
The Chips Thermal Face Dataset is a large-scale (over 1,200 images, Male and Female, from 3 different continents, aged 18-23) thermal face dataset. This dataset will be available to researches worldwide to create accurate thermal facial classification and thermal facial recogintion  systems using state-of-the art deep learning methods.

### Source
Images were captured using a FLIR® Lepton 3.5 Thermal Imaging Camera.

### Image Variation
The images are varied in multiple ways:
1. [Location captured] Pictures were taken in different room around a house and some were taken outdoors.
2. [Surrounding Hot Objects] Some locations included radiators, kitchen appliances, computer screens, etc. which are hot objects that will be prominent  in the thermal images. Contrastingly, some locations did not contain hot objects.
3. [Face distance from Camera] Candidates were asked to stand a variety of distances from the camera.
4. [Color] 5 different color modes were applied to each scenario.
5. [Items Worn on Faces] A variety of items were worn on/across candidates faces including hats, jumper hoods, face masks, glasses, scarfs, etc. 
6. [Face Orientation] Candidates were asked to rotate their head to face a varying range of degrees to the camera ranging from -80 to 80 degrees (zero meaning directly facing the camera).

In addition, candidates were asked to take a series of images as a group, and in some cases allowed to pose any way of their own choosing to make images more diverse.

### Image Files Naming Convention
Candidates in the dataset were each assigned a number. The name for each image file in the dataset was composed of the candidate name and an image number respectively, separated by an underscore. 

### Annotations
Annotations are also provided as part of the repository. These annotations are stored in the YOLO (You Only Look Once) annotation format. Each annotation has a class index of value zero since 'face' is the only class annotated.

### Terms and Conditions
The researcher shall use the dataset only for non-commercial research and educational purposes. Any commercial distribution or act related to the commercial usage of this dataset is strictly prohibited.

**Any publication using this database must reference to this.**

### Disclaimer
Participants included in this dataset agreed it being made publiclly accessible. Appropiate steps have been taken to preserve the anonymity of participants.
